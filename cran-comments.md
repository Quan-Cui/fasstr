## Resubmission

This is a resubmission (initial submission 2019-12-12).
Github link of this version is in the "devel" branch located here: https://github.com/bcgov/fasstr/tree/devel. 
In this version I have:

* Shortened the title to less than 65 characters
* Added a link to the Water Survey of Canada database (removed short-form name) in the Description
* Added references to methods in the description field in the DESCRIPTION file
* Replaced "Apache License (==2.0)" with "Apache License 2.0" in the DESCRIPTION file, and removed the "| file LICENSE" text
* Replaced \dontrun{} for most function documentation examples with an if-statement that checks for a local HYDAT (required for examples to run/test)
* Kept \dontrun{} for function documentation examples with longer run times (tests > 5sec) or functions that write files to disk
